 * Revision 1.2121.2.31  2007/06/04 09:19:36  dsandras
 * Backport from HEAD. (Removed redundant locking, patch from Robert).
 *
 * Revision 2.120.2.30  2007/05/23 20:52:32  dsandras
 * We should release the current session if no ACK is received after
 * an INVITE answer for a period of 64*T1. Don't trigger the ACK timer
 * when sending an ACK, only when not receiving one.
 *
 * Revision 2.120.2.29  2007/05/21 13:41:00  csoutheren
 * Backport from head
 *
 * Revision 2.120.2.28  2007/04/21 10:43:16  dsandras
 * Fixed more interoperability problems due to bugs in Cisco Call Manager.
 * Do not clear calls if the video transport can not be established.
 * Only reinitialize the registrar transport if required (STUN is being used
 * and the public IP address has changed).
 *
 * Revision 2.120.2.27  2007/04/15 09:54:46  dsandras
 * Some systems like CISCO Call Manager do like having a Contact field in INVITE
 * PDUs which is different to the one being used in the original REGISTER request.
 * Added code to use the same Contact field in both cases if we can determine that
 * we are registered to that specific account and if there is a transport running.
 * Fixed problem where the SIP connection was not released with a BYE PDU when
 * the ACK is received while we are already in EstablishedPhase.
 *
 * Revision 2.120.2.26  2007/03/15 21:19:48  dsandras
 * Make sure lastTransportAddress is correctly initialized even when
 * uncompliant SIP PDUs are received.

 * some broken SIP Proxies. (Ekiga report #359971)
